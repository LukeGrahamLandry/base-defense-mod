# Base Defense Mod

- forge 1.18.2
- commissioned by 2To16Hobos

## Features 

Materials are added by datapacks. What materials the player currently has is shown in a gui (opened by pressing 'm' by default). 
There are generator blocks that give you specific materials over time (even when in an unloaded chunk). 
You can right click a generator to see how much it generates and spend some of your materials to upgrade it. 

The default set of materials and generators are in the `basedefensedefaults` data pack and can be disabled by running the command `/datapack disable basedefensedefaults` if you so choose. 
You should only do that if you're using another datapack/mod that adds its own materials and the defaults don't fit with your intended gameplay.
